#ChatApp Using A Remote Server
**Group Project** 

In this project we were assigned partners and tasked with creating a chat app using HTML, Sass, vanilla JavaScript, jQuery, Underscore, Backbone & Bootstrap. The due date for this project gave us a 2 day turn around time. Jennifer (<https://github.com/jennifermmiller>) and I worked as a team and started off by defining our basic content, wireframing and coding structure. After pair programming on the first day we split up the project into sepaerate tasks making use of GitHub's branching & merging capabilities.
